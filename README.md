# EWS Multiple Window Method
This contains code for determining the warning time of Early Warning Signals (EWS).

## Note
In my codes I use a plotting toolbox called <a href="https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/100766-professional-plots">Professional Plots<\a>
This allows me to plot better.
